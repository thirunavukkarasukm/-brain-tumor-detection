Implemented a deep learning-based solution to classify brain MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including image augmentation, contour cropping, resizing, and normalization. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically designed architectures were constructed, trained, and evaluated for accurate classification.
